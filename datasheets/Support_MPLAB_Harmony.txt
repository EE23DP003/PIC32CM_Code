TC3 -> 1s, 48MHz, 1024 pre-scaler, 16 bit mode
TC4 -> 0.001s, 48MHZ, 16 bit mode



MPLAB® DISCOVER:
This platform on Microchip's website allows searching for projects and examples based on specific PIC32MK devices (e.g., PIC32MK1024MCM100). You can find examples demonstrating features like multiple USB Host/Device operation.

GitHub Repository (Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/mc_apps_pic32mk):
This repository hosts the source code for various PIC32MK application examples, providing a direct way to access and explore the code. Online documentation for these examples is also available.

Getting Started Guides and Training Modules:
Microchip offers detailed guides, such as "Getting Started with MPLAB® Harmony v3 Peripheral Libraries on PIC32MK GP MCUs," which walk you through the process of setting up a project and integrating example code. These guides often include code snippets and instructions for specific functionalities like reading sensor data or controlling LEDs.

MPLAB® Code Configurator (MCC):
This graphical tool within MPLAB X IDE simplifies the configuration of peripherals and middleware, generating the necessary Harmony framework code.
